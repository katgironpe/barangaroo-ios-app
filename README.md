# iOS App Design and Development


## Installation

Install Cocoapods and Fastlane

```
[sudo] gem install cocoapods fastlane
```

Using `sudo` is optional if you have installed Ruby via Rbenv. Please let me know if you have Ruby questions. I have worked as a Ruby software developer for over 7 years.

Install the dependencies of the app


```
pod install
```
